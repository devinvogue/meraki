                    <br>"Like many people in the world, the problems of fellow human beings do not leave me indifferent. I always wanted to see the whole of humanity stand against injustice and human misery, against poverty and violence."</p>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The Mafubo International Federation fights extreme poverty, insecurity and the various forms of violence against women in Africa and elsewhere. Mafubo aims to ensure that girls from disadvantaged backgrounds are guaranteed conditions for academic success. Established in more than 40 countries women under the same banner carrying the same dreams to achieve the same goals. This is what we are.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>From the Rwandan culture, the word Mafubo has become a name with an international destiny; Easy to write, read and pronounce, Mafubo means the confidante with a global connotation to designate solidarity between women. Mafubo designates a woman who has a great deal of compassion for the other; she is the one who forgets herself to support and especially to spare the other, shame, humiliation and degradation. Mafubo designates a friend to whom one confides without net and without restraint, especially when one needs to be supported. It is a strong expression of women’s solidarity, one of the main principles of our Federation. Every woman should be a Mafubo for another woman, and every woman should have a Mafubo in her life. But the important thing is that every woman should deserve another woman to call her Mafubo. This chain of solidarity must take root around us in our communities and then stain and go further. This is how we will build active and borderless solidarity. With the new communication technologies, we have no more excuses. We can do it.</p>
