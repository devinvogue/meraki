                <p style="margin-bottom:20px !important;">From the Rwandan culture, the word Mafubo has become a name with an international destiny; Easy to write, read and pronounce, Mafubo means the confidante with a global connotation to designate solidarity between women. Mafubo designates a woman who has a great deal of compassion for the other; she is the one who forgets herself to support and especially to spare the other, shame, humiliation and degradation. Mafubo designates a friend to whom one confides without net and without restraint, especially when one needs to be supported. It is a strong expression of womenâ€™s solidarity, one of the main principles of our Federation.</p>
                <p>Mafubo fights against women's extreme poverty and insecurity. It is apolitical and non-denominational. Projects stem from the needs and priorities identified by local teams.and are implemented with local people. Mafubo is organized so that the impact of its work within a community can be quickly and easily assessed and evaluated. Its effect on communities must be fast and visible.</p>

                         <p>Every woman should be a Mafubo for another woman, and every woman should have a Mafubo in her life. But the important thing is that every woman should deserve another woman to call her Mafubo. This chain of solidarity must take root around us in our communities and then stain and go further. This is how we will build active and borderless solidarity. With the new communication technologies, we have no more excuses. We can do it.</p><br><br><br>

It aims at ensuring that girls from disadvantaged backgrounds are guaranteed conditions for academic success. Mafubo is trying to resolve this is by improving access to quality gender data. We recognize that better gender data will allow us to examine, identify and understand many problems and aspirations specific to women, including maternal mortality rates. The collection and use of this data is central to helping donors better target their spending, while equally enabling civil society to develop more precise recommendations.</p>

                    <p>It has therefore been established in more than 40 countries where women under the same banner share the same dreams to achieve the same goals.</p><br><br>
